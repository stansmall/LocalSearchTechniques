;;; Class: individual
;;; Slots:  
;;;    - state:  	the current state of the problem
;;;    - fitness: 	an evaluated fitness of the current state based on a fitness-fn
;;; Description:
;;;    	This class holds all information necessary to represent an indidivdual in a 
;;;		population or a neighboring state in the simulated annealing algorithm, both 
;;;		candidate solutions for the given problem. 
;;;

;;; Functions: getfitness, getstate
;;; Arguments:  
;;;    - an individual: used to retrive a state or fitness value
;;; Description:
;;;    	These are accessor methods for the individual class. Storing the fitness value
;;;		along with the state drastically reduces computation time. NOTE: the acessor 
;;;		does not compute the fitness fucntion if it is not availible. It must be used
;;;		at discression of the user.

;;; Class: problem
;;; Slots:  
;;;    - fitness-fn: a problem-specific fitness function
;;;    - mutate-fn: a problem-specific fucntion used for mutation
;;;	   - reproduce-fn: a problem-specific fucntion for reproduction in a ga
;;;	   - population-fn: a function used to create an initial population
;;; Description:
;;;    	This class holds specific functions for each problem to be used in the 
;;;		domain independent algorithms. Each problem must be tuned to achieve best
;;;		performance during search.

;;; Problem: 8queens
;;; Description:
;;;    	The 8-queens problem has a goal of arranging 8 queens on a chessboard in a 
;;;		way so that they do not attack each other. These domain-specific functions 
;;;		are designed to optimise perfomance of the local search algorithms. 
;;;

;;; Method: queensfitness
;;; Arguments: 
;;;		- i: an individual
;;;	Description:
;;;		This fucntion counts the number of non-attacking pairs of queens on a chessboard.

;;; Fucntion: queenspop
;;; Arguments: 
;;;		- size: the size of the poplation
;;;		- fitness-fn: a domain-dependent evaluation for the fitness of an individual
;;; Description:

;;;
;;; Problem: tsp
;;; Description:
;;;    	The traveling salesperson problem is an NP-hard problem with a goal of 
;;;		finding the shortest path between a number of cities with given distances. 
;;;		These domain-specific functions are designed to optimise perfomance of the

;;; Arguments: 
;;;		- cityquantity: the number of cities
;;;		- mindistance: the minimum number of distance units between cities
;;;		- maxistance: the maximum number of distance units between cities
;;; Description:
;;;    	This function will generate a random TSP problem given the number of cities and

;;; 
;;; Method: tspfitness
;;; Arguments: 
;;;		- i: an individual
;;;	Description:
;;;		This fucntion calculates the cost of the current path, but returns the reciprocal so 
;;;		shorter paths are evaluated as more optimal than longer paths. If a path does not begin 
;;;		and end at the same place, then itâ€™s penalized, as it is if a city occurs more than once 
;;;		(other than start and end). NOTE: This fucntion was inspired by Dr. Roy Turner's work.

;;;
;;; Fucntion: annealing
;;; Arguments: 
;;;		- p: an problem
;;;		- schedule: a schedule for the temperature to cool in the function
;;; Description:
;;;    	The simulated annealing algorithm is similar to the hill-climbing algorithm, 
;;;		aside from the fact that the agorithm allows the selection of sub-optimal moves
;;;		to avoid the possibility of finding a local maximum in favor of a global one. 
;;;		As time passes, errors are less likely to occur. When the temperature reaches 0
;;;		The current individual is returned.

;;; Arguments:

;;;		- mutate-fn: a domain-specific function used to mutate an individual state
;;; Description:

;;;		mutate-fn, then returns that individual. 
;;;

;;;
;;; Function: ga 
;;; Arguments:  
;;;     - p: a problem (either 8queens or tsp)
;;;		- popsize: the size of the population
;;;		- stopfitness: the desired fitness set to stop the search
;;;		- mutationchance: a mutation rate percentage (0 to 100)
;;;		- weight: 	a factor to which fitness plays a role
;;;					(i.e. a higher weight will select fit individuals more often)
;;;	Description: 
;;;		This is a domain-independent implementation of a genetic algorithm inspired 
;;;		by pseudocode written by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. The fucntion is
;;;		passed a series of domain-dependent functions as specified by the CLOS problem
;;;		object. Once an initial population is created, parents are selected with a 
;;;		random weighted selection, where the weight factor can be adjusted. The 
;;;		parents undergo a crossover, producing a child which has a chance of mutation.
;;;		Each child is added to the new population and the new-population replaces the
;;;		old population. The search stops when an individual reaches a fitnes passed as
;;;		a parameter to the function.

;;; Arguments:  
;;;     - population: a population
;;;     - fitness-fn: a domain-dependent fitness-fn
;;;		- weight: a factor to which the weights will be amplified
;;;	Description: 
;;;		This fucntion randomly selects an individual from a population with a greater
;;;		preference for individuals with a higher fitness value. The factor to which 
;;;		the fitness of an indivudal impacts the choice can be modified by the weight
;;;		argument. The fitness of each individul is summed, then a threshold value is 
;;;		chosen. Indivduals are then added until the threshold is reached, then that 
;;;		individual is returned.
